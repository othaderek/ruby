# ruby
For all things related to learning and practicing ruby.

I want to update this daily with any ruby lessons I've learned and periodically go back and refine some of the content I put here. 

I will also add a .txt file to this repo with a list of projects that I want to make using ruby. Some of them may be rails apps, some might just be ruby automation scripts or something like that. I haven't really decided yet.
