||/* Javascript things to master (For advanced JS) */|| 
-------------------------------------------------------

These are notes that I've taken from a Chris Hawkes Youtube video
Link here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIioG0cx0Wo



1. This Keyword
	What is it? Why does it work? How does it work?

2. Functions
	Functions are first-class objects in JS. They can be passed
	around like strings and numbers. They can be anonymous (named
	or unnamed). Callbacks.

3. Prototypes
	Understand how new objects are created and how prototypal enheritance works. 

4. IIFE & Modules
	Why does IIFE exist? JQuery uses this pattern.

5. Global Namespace
	Dont attach things to a window object

6. Closures
	Creates interesting ways to approach or solve problems. Really understanding lexical scope is important.

7. Babel vs Typescript
	What do they each aim to do? Who is behind these projects?

8. Object constructors
	
9. Specification
	ECMA script specification. READ IT.

10. Chrome Dev Tools
	Understand how to execute JS from console. 
	Good for inspecting JS objects and executing small statements
